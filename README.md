# Shaft-integrated Force Sensing with Transformer-based Dynamics Compensation for Telesurgery

[[Project Page](link)] 

## Overview

This project implements a transformer architecture to predict 3D force (Fx, Fy, Fz) from sensory inputs including joint positions, velocities, efforts, and IMU measurements. The package includes data loading, model training, evaluation, and visualization utilities.

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd shaft_force_sensing

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

### Dependencies Only

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
